# üëã Meet SahomeDB

SahomeDB is an **embeddable**, **efficient**, and **easy to use** vector database. It is designed to be used as a library and embedded inside your AI application. It is written in Rust and uses [Sled](https://docs.rs/sled) as its persistence storage engine to save vector collections to the disk.

SahomeDB implements **HNSW** (Hierachical Navigable Small World) as its indexing algorithm. It is a state-of-the-art algorithm that is used by many vector databases. It is fast, memory efficient, and it scales well to large datasets.

## Why SahomeDB?

SahomeDB is very flexible for use cases related with vector search such as using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) method with an LLM to generate a context-aware output. SahomeDB offers 2 major features that make it stand out from other vector databases or libraries:

- **Incremental vector operations**: SahomeDB allows you to add, remove, or modify vectors from the collections without having to rebuild their indexes. This allows for a more flexible and efficient approach on storing your vector data.
- **Flexible persistence options**: You can choose to persist the vector collection to the disk or to keep it in memory. By default, whenever you use a collection, it will be loaded to the memory to ensure that the search performance is high.

üöÄ Quickstart

This is a code snippet that you can use as a reference to get started with SahomeDB. In short, use `Collection` to store your vector records or search similar vector and use `Database` to persist a vector collection to the disk.

```rust
// This is a complete, runnable example
use sahomedb::collection::*;
use sahomedb::database::Database;
use sahomedb::vector::*;

fn main() {
    // Vector dimension must be uniform.
    let dimension = 128;

    // Replace with your own data.
    let records = Record::many_random(dimension, 100);
    let query = Vector::random(dimension);

    // Open the database and create a collection.
    let mut db = Database::open("data/readme").unwrap();
    let collection =
        db.create_collection("vectors", None, Some(&records)).unwrap();

    // Search for the nearest neighbors.
    let result = collection.search(&query, 5).unwrap();
    println!("Nearest ID: {}", result[0].id);
}
```

# üèÅ Benchmarks

SahomeDB has a built-in benchmarking suite using Rust's [Criterion](https://docs.rs/criterion) crate that can be used to measure the performance of the vector database.

Currently, the benchmarks are focused on the performance of the collection's vector search functionality. We are working on adding more benchmarks to measure the performance of other operations.

If you are curious and want to run the benchmarks, you can use the following command which will download the benchmarking dataset and run the benchmarks:

```bash
cargo bench
```
